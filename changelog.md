# Idée:

- Ajouter un broadcast de message centré avec le support des \n pour ajouter plusieurs lignes
- Ajouter une option pour désactiver la tabulation des joueurs hors ligne
- Ajouter un placeholder pour transformed les caractères en lettre spécial

# 1.0.4.0

- Added a **network chat relay** (`modules/bungeechat/config.yml`, disabled by default): public chat is broadcast across BungeeCord/Velocity networks through the plugin messaging channel with a configurable `%server% %player% %message%` format
- Polished `/r`: answering without a previous private message now explains it instead of failing silently

- Added **chat bubbles** (`modules/bubbles/config.yml`): every chat message appears as a text display floating above the speaker head, messages stack on top of each other and disappear after a configured time; background color, scale, stack offset and view distance are configurable

- Added a reusable **screen factory** (`dev.yanianz.essentials.screens`) for list style inventories with pagination, control row and slot bound click callbacks; other plugins can reuse it through `EssentialsScreens.get().factory()`
- Added `/baltopgui [economy]`: the balance top as a paginated player head screen
- Added `/warpgui`: every permitted warp as a clickable entry teleporting on click

- Added a **chat customization** module (`/chatcolor` and `/tags`): guis to pick a chat color (16 colors, bold and italic with a permission), decorations are toggleable and every choice is saved in json and applied live in the rendered chat; configurable prefix **tags** with per tag permissions (`modules/chatcustomization/config.yml`)

- Added a **nickname** module (`/nick`): colored display names with length/character validation, impersonation protection, a change cooldown (`essentials.nicknames.bypass.cooldown`) and json persistence re-applied on join; staff target others with `/nick <player> <name|off>`
- Added a **report** system (`/report <player> <reason>`): staff online receive a clickable alert with sound, `/reports` lists the open reports with resolve and teleport buttons, everything is persisted in `reports.json`

- **Raid protection**: identical chat messages from several different players inside a short window cancel the messages, alert every moderator and can run configured console actions (`raid-protection` in `modules/chat/config.yml`)
- **Warning escalation**: `warning-escalation` thresholds in the sanction configuration run console commands when a player reaches an amount of warnings (3 -> 1 day ban, 5 -> long ban by default)
- Added `/warnings <player>` listing every stored warning with reason and date
- Added private **staff notes**: `/note add <player> <text...>`, `/notes <player>` and `/notes clear <player>` persisted in json

- Added **polls** (`/poll create <seconds> <question> | option 1 | option 2 ...`): clickable voting lines broadcast to everyone, one vote per player, live result bars and winner announcement; `/poll vote <index>` and `/poll stop`
- Added a **reputation** system: `/rep <player>` gives one point with a configurable cooldown per giver (24h default), `/reputation [player]` displays the score, persisted in `reputations.json`

- Added a **chat games** module (`modules/chatgames/config.yml`): six game types — math race, word scramble, fast typing, reversed words, trivia and hot letter — with automatic random rounds (`auto-interval-minutes`), console reward commands (`%player%`) and `/chatgames <type|stop|reload>` for staff

- Chat slowmode: `/chatslowmode <seconds>` staff command with `essentials.chat.bypass.slowmode` bypass
- Do not disturb mode: `/dnd [player]` disables mention notification sounds per player
- Emoji shortcuts: ten defaults like `:heart:` or `:100:` replaced in every chat message (`emoji-shortcuts`)
- Staff message deletion: moderators see a clickable `[✖]` on every line of `/chathistory <player>` removing the stored message instantly

- Raised the build to **paper-api 26.2** with full **adventure 5** compatibility
- Duration arguments now accept every unit with combinations: `30s`, `15m`, `12h`, `7d`, `2w`, `6mo`, `3y`, `1d12h30m` — used by `/fly add|set|remove`, bans and mutes; a plain number stays seconds
- Economy amounts accept compact magnitudes everywhere: `1k`, `1.5m`, `2b`, `3t`
- The terms of service screen uses the **native minecraft dialog ui** on 1.21.7+ servers (chest interface kept as fallback for older versions)
- Added `freeze.persist-across-restarts` (default false): restarts always release frozen players, stale freeze flags from previous sessions are cleaned up automatically on join

- **Reworked the freeze system**: `/freeze <player>` now freezes (idempotent) and a new `/unfreeze <player>` releases; a frozen player cannot move at all, glows blue and is surrounded by a continuous circle of snowflake particles; walk/fly speeds are correctly restored on unfreeze (fixing players stuck unable to move); the sanction GUI freeze button keeps its toggle behavior
- The main command is now `/essentials` (`/zessentials` kept as alias)
- The custom screens module moved to the `dev.yanianz.essentials.customscreens` package — all new features now live under `dev.yanianz.essentials`
- **Fixed** the effects module being silently disabled: runtime fields are no longer overwritten by the configuration loader (this also fixes missing effects on `/tpa` and `/rtp`)
- **The terms of service is now a custom screen** instead of chat messages: a 45 slots interface with the rules, clickable accept and refuse buttons, that cannot be closed without an answer
- New startup/shutdown console banners with an rgb gradient title and server informations

- **Fixed** the scoreboard crashing on join with `IllegalAccessException` on modern Paper servers — upgraded FastBoard to 2.2.1 which converts components correctly on Mojang-mapped runtimes
- **Fixed** the chat crashing when showing an item with `NoSuchFieldError: ClickEvent$Action.RUN_COMMAND` — the click event now uses the version-stable adventure factory
- Added a console startup/shutdown banner with versions, command/module counts and timings
- Added a new **effects** module (`modules/effects/config.yml`): configurable particle rings and sounds for teleports (tpa/warp/spawn/home/tp...), game mode changes, flight toggles plus blessing sparkles for `/heal` and `/god`
- Added a new **terms of service** module (`modules/terms/config.yml`): new players receive the server rules with clickable accept/refuse buttons, players who refuse or do not answer in time are kicked; acceptances are remembered (`/terms reload`, `/terms reset <player>` admin commands)
- **Fixed** expired sanction cleanup on SQLite querying the wrong table (`no such column: expired_at`)
- **Fixed** duplicate message keys in the default configuration triggering warnings on every start
- **Fixed** the custom screens example layout not being extracted from the jar on first launch

- Added a **runtime dependency loader** (package `dev.yanianz.essentials.dependency`) modeled after Intave's library system:
    - Detects whether a dependency is already available on the classpath (plugin.yml libraries, shaded jar or another plugin) — if so nothing is installed
    - Otherwise restores it from the local cache folder (`plugins/zEssentials/libs`, maven layout) or downloads it from Maven Central
    - Downloads are verified against the published SHA-256 / SHA-1 / MD5 checksums and written atomically, a corrupted download never reaches the cache
    - The jar is pushed into the running classloader without restarting the server (URLClassLoader `addURL`, Unsafe fallback on modern JVMs)
    - The JDBC driver (MariaDB/MySQL) is resolved automatically before the database storage connects
- **zMenu and PlaceholderAPI are no longer hard dependencies**: the server now loads zEssentials without them and installs the missing ones at startup
    - PlaceholderAPI is downloaded automatically from Hangar and enabled immediately, without any restart
    - zMenu is downloaded automatically from Modrinth (latest paper build); because it ships a paper-plugin.yml bootstrapper, Paper forbids hot-loading it at runtime, so one restart is required the very first time only
    - Downloads are idempotent: an already staged jar is never fetched again
    - If a required plugin cannot be resolved, zEssentials disables itself cleanly instead of crashing the plugin loading
    - Every direct zMenu api call moved out of the main plugin class into a bridge (`dev.yanianz.essentials.dependency.ZMenuBridge`), so its class verification succeeds even when zMenu is not installed yet and the auto-installer can run
- Added a new **custom screens** module (`modules/customscreens/config.yml`) to create your own inventory screens opened with a command:
    - Each entry defines the `command` (with `aliases`, `permission`, `description`) that opens the zMenu inventory stored in `modules/customscreens/screens/<name>.yml`
    - Screens use the standard zMenu format: items per slot, click actions (console/player commands, messages, sounds, open another screen), patterns, pagination and PlaceholderAPI placeholders
    - Optional open conditions per screen: restricted `worlds` and/or `gamemodes`
    - Optional `open-sound` played when the screen opens; close sounds are available natively with zMenu `close-actions`
    - Commands are registered at runtime, removed safely on `/ezreload` without duplicating anything, and a screen command that would override an existing zEssentials command is refused with a message in the console
- Added `/tpaall` command — sends a teleport request to every online player at once; players who ignored you or disabled teleport requests are skipped silently (permission `essentials.tpa.all`)
- Added `/list` command — displays online players sorted alphabetically with the player count, vanished players are hidden from viewers who cannot see them (permission `essentials.list`)
- Added `/itemdb` command — displays information about the item in your hand: material name, namespaced key, amount and max stack size (permission `essentials.itemdb`)
- Added warn sanctions through the sanction GUI — warns are saved like other sanctions, the target receives a configurable message (`message-warn`) and staff with `essentials.warn.notify` receive a broadcast (`command-warn-notify`)
- Fixed hover events (`show_item` and `show_entity`) when reading components using the modern `contents` JSON format — items are now parsed from both the legacy `item` field and the vanilla `id` field instead of being misread as text
- Fixed expired ban/mute sanctions never being cleared when using SQLite storage — expired sanctions are now resolved with an `IN` subquery instead of an unsupported `UPDATE ... LEFT JOIN`
- Completed the missing translations of every language file: 71 keys for Chinese (death message module, toggle commands, teleport queue, item frame), 17-20 for German/Spanish/Italian and 13 for French/Dutch

# 1.0.3.9

- **New configuration option**: enable the "First join teleport" in the `config.yml` file; it is now disabled by default.
- **Added** Faststats https://faststats.dev/project/zessentials/.
- **Changed** method signature in the configuration interface.
- **Fixed** MySQL error on create user home tables.
- **Fixed** Teleport world command permission.

# 1.0.3.8

- Added **text mails** to the mailbox module, to send a message to a player who is not connected (`modules/mailbox/config.yml`):
    - `/mail send <player> <message>` works with an online or offline player, `/mail read` displays the received mails and marks them as read, `/mail clearmessages [player]` deletes them and `/mail sendall <message>` sends a mail to every online player
    - A player who connects with unread mails is notified with a clickable message (`message-notify-on-join`, `message-notify-delay`)
    - Configurable limits: `message-max-amount` per player, `message-max-length`, `message-cooldown` between two mails (bypassed with `essentials.bypass.cooldown`) and `message-date-format`
    - A muted player cannot send a mail, and a player who used `/ignore` no longer receives the mails of the ignored player
    - Persistence via a new `user_mail_messages` table (SQLite and MySQL) and inside the user file for the JSON storage, unlike the item mailbox which stays MySQL only
    - New permissions `essentials.mail.send`, `essentials.mail.read`, `essentials.mail.send.all` and `essentials.mail.clear.messages`
- Fixed the build of the `NMS:V26_2` module: since Minecraft 26.1 the built in entity types are declared in `EntityTypes` and no longer in `EntityType`, so `EntityType.BLOCK_DISPLAY`, `ITEM_DISPLAY` and `TEXT_DISPLAY` could not be resolved anymore
- Fixed `shadowJar` failing with `Unsupported class file major version 69` — the `NMS:V26_2` module still builds with a Java 25 toolchain (needed to read the 26.2 dev bundle) but now emits Java 21 bytecode, which the ASM version bundled with the shadow plugin can remap
- Added a new **custom commands** module (`modules/customcommands/config.yml`) to create your own commands without any other plugin, for `/discord`, `/map`, `/vote`, `/store`, `/updates`...
    - Each command can define `aliases`, a `permission`, a `description`, a `cooldown` in seconds (bypassed with `essentials.bypass.cooldown`) and a list of `messages`
    - `type` selects how the content is displayed: `TCHAT`, `CENTER`, `ACTION`, `TITLE`, `BOSSBAR` or `NONE`
    - MiniMessage, legacy colors and PlaceholderAPI placeholders are supported, so `<click:open_url:'...'>` can be used to display clickable links
    - zMenu `actions` can be run after the messages (sound, command, inventory, ...)
    - Commands are registered at runtime and `/ezreload` updates them without duplicating anything; a custom command that would override an existing zEssentials command is refused with a message in the console
- Added display options for `/seen` in `modules/sanction/config.yml` — `seen-show-uuid`, `seen-show-ip`, `seen-show-last-location`, `seen-show-created-at` and `seen-show-playtime`. The IP address can now be hidden globally, even from operators: until now it was only protected by the `essentials.seen.show.ip` permission, which an operator always has
- Fixed several configuration options being silently ignored: they were declared as `private final` fields with a constant initializer, so javac inlined them at compile time and the value read from the configuration file was never used
    - Sanction module: `date-format`, `kick-default-reason`, `ban-default-reason`, `mute-default-reason`, `unmute-default-reason`, `unban-default-reason`
    - Spawn module: `respawn-listener-priority` and `spawn-join-listener-priority` — the respawn and join listeners were always registered with the `NORMAL` priority instead of the configured one (`HIGHEST` by default)
    - Worldedit module: `enable-color-visualisation` and `open-help-inventory`
- Clarified the `/compact` and `/compactall` descriptions to mention their existing `/condense` and `/condenseall` aliases
- Fixed the chat ping sound not playing on Paper 1.21.3+ — `org.bukkit.Sound` became an interface, so the ping sound is now resolved cross-version through the zMenu XSound API (like the teleportation sounds)
- Fixed countdown/teleport placeholders (`%name%`, `%seconds%`, ...) showing as raw text when the message `type` is set to `TITLE` or `BOSSBAR` — internal placeholders are now resolved for every message type
- Added `/pingsound` command (`/pingsounds` alias) to toggle the chat ping sound per player; the `enable-player-ping-sound` global toggle is now honored
- Added `/tp <player1> <player2>` — teleport one player to another player
- Added a player ignore system with persistence (`user_ignores` table):
    - `/ignore <player>` blocks a player's private messages and teleport requests (`/tpa`, `/tpahere`)
    - `/unignore <player>` and `/ignorelist` (`/ignores` alias)
    - Works for online and offline targets, persists across restarts (MySQL and JSON storage)
- Added `/delhome-other <player> <home>` (`/delhomeother`, `/hdelother` aliases) — admin command to delete a specific home of another player (online or offline), with permission `essentials.del.home.other`
- Added persistence for `/ptime` and `/pweather` — the per-player time and weather are now saved and re-applied automatically when the player reconnects
- Fixed private messages to a vanished player revealing their presence when they had ignored the sender — the vanish check now takes precedence over the ignore check
- Removed the non-functional `itemadders-font-regex` chat config options (the feature was never wired) and corrected the `/sc` reference in the chat config comment (it is `/chathistory`)
- Added a Homes system enhancement (see `modules/home/config.yml`):
    - **Public homes** — `/homepublic <home>` makes a home visitable by everyone, `/publichomes [player]` lists them (in chat or a paginated GUI via `public-homes-display: CHAT|INVENTORY`); visit with `/home <player>:<home>` (permissions `essentials.home.public`, `essentials.home.visit`, configurable `max-public-homes`)
    - **Shared homes** — `/homeshare <home> <player>`, `/homeunshare`, `/homeshares` to share a home with specific players (online or offline); shares are purged when the home is deleted (permission `essentials.home.share`, `max-shared-per-home`)
    - **Categories** — `/homecategory <home> <category>` to organise homes (permission `essentials.home.category`), placeholder `%category%`
    - **Favorites** — `/homefavorite <home>` to mark a home as favorite; `favorite-first` shows favorites at the top (permission `essentials.home.favorite`), placeholder `%favorite%`
    - **Preview** — optional `enable-home-preview` shows a clickable confirmation before teleporting
    - **Import** — `/homeimport essentialsx` imports homes from EssentialsX (permission `essentials.home.import`)
    - Persistence via new `is_public`/`category`/`is_favorite` columns on `user_homes` and a new `user_home_shares` table (MySQL and JSON storage)
- Updated zMenu to `1.1.1.6` and added support for Minecraft/Paper **26.2**:
    - Added a new `NMS:V26_2` module (built against the `26.2.build.+` dev bundle, compiled with Java 25 which Minecraft 26.x requires)
    - Migrated the whole plugin to **Mojang mappings** — Paper 26.1+ removed Spigot reobfuscation, so every NMS module now uses `MOJANG_PRODUCTION` and the shaded jar is marked `paperweight-mappings-namespace: mojang`
    - **zEssentials is now Paper-only and requires Paper 1.20.5+ — Minecraft 1.20.4 is no longer supported** (Mojang-mapped plugins only load on 1.20.5+)
    - Replaced the removed zMenu `NmsVersion` enum with the new `MinecraftVersion` API for version detection and NMS package resolution (`NmsVersionUtils`)
    - Bumped `paperweight-userdev` to `2.0.0-beta.21`

# 1.0.3.7
